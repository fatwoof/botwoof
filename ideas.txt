Ideas to implement

feed command instead of on_message method
fetchitem command or blank fetch command
	-bring back random emoji
	-small chance of it being reddit gold
	-1-180s wait
	-50% chance of slobber with returned item
shake
sit
subwoofer - ?
make botwoof go rogue every once in a while
	-end rogue after some time
	-don't go rogue on serious discussions channel
	-he should count down from 10 and (fake) kick you if you don't send the message

To do

fetch user avatar - multiple requests
have botwoof greed new members - on_member_join is event name
